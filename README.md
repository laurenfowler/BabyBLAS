# BabyBLAS

Optimized Basic Linear Algerba Subroutines (BLAS)

Uses single proccessor optimaztion as well as shared memory multiprocessing using OpenMP and pThreads

Subroutines are built in C/C++ which are built into libraries using a Makefile and can be called from C/C++/Fortran 

Subroutines: 
  1. inner (dot) product of two matricies
  2. tensor product of two vectors
  3. matrix/vector multiplication
  4. matrix/matrix multiplication
  5. direct linear solver
  6. iterative linear solver
